### Hi!

**TL;DR:** This is a template for a website presenting some type of productivity software. It's a great template to showcase your own product! **To use it, just fork the Repl and edit the content! :)**

It has the following sections/pages:

- Navbar
- Landing	page
	- Trusted by
	- Features (multiple & individual)
- Product page
- About page
	- Values
  - Image gallery
  - Team
- Reviews page

- Footer

This website is completely responsive, meaning that you can view it on any device, like computer, tablet, or phone!

The general style of this site is meant to be modern, clean, and simple. It includes themes like boldness, technology, futuristic, etc. Sleek shadows and smooth gradients are combined with some neumorphic elements for a nice contrast.
