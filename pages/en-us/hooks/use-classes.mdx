## useClasses

Technically, this is not a hooks, it just uses the nomenclature of hooks as well.
`useClasses` is used to mix strings, objects, expressions, etc. into class-names, and remove the extra space characters.
It is actually similar in function to [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames), but much more compact and lower of size.

The original purpose of creating an additional hooks instead of using a package from the community was to reduce the size of the package,
there are not a lot of complex class-names expressions to deal with in _Geist_, just for regular space sign removal.

### Basic usage


export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
